			<div class="six columns valignhalf">
				<p>In order to better understand this industry and find out where the product currently fit within the market I conducted a competitor analysis.</p>
				<p>I focused on companies with a similar target market: small to mid-sized rental companies.</p>
				<p>Along with the analysis, I included a detailed list of suggested product enhancements. This list included features that the top competitors had but my client was missing.</p>

		<h2><i class="fa fa-search"></i> Content Audit</h2>
		<p class="centerfull">It was very important to have a clear picture of the product’s current content and structure. I conducted a full content inventory to assess what changes would be necessary to improve the information architecture and enhance the product’s functionality.</p>

			<div class="six columns valigndouble">
				<p>As the list of current and desired functionality grew, it became important to prioritize each item. To do this I completed a red route analysis. The red routes (items in the red squares) are the critical user tasks for the product and these together represent the minimum viable product (MVP).</p>
				<p>During design and development red routes should always be prioritized, user-centric and remain obstacle-free</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<hr>

		<h2><i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i> User Flows</h2>
		<p class="centerfull">I created user flows for each red route task. This helped ensure that each flow was prioritized and obstacle-free. I made sure to include multiple access points, a clear start and finish and illustrated steps in sequential order. </p>

			<div class="six columns valigndouble">
				<p>Once I had a clear list of requirements for the new design I conducted a card sorting exercise. This was done to better understand how people expect the content to be organized.</p>
				<p>In the card sorting session, participants were asked to organize tasks into pre-defined categories in a way that made the most sense to them. The categories given were the main navigation of the application and included an “other” category.</p>
				<p>The results were displayed in a popular placement matrix. This demonstrated the percentage of participants that sorted a task into each category.</p>

		<h2><i class="fa fa-edit"></i> Wireframes</h2>
		<p class="centerfull">I created wireframes for desktop and tablet screens. Through the wireframes I was able to design user flows, navigation, and interactions. The wireframes were annotation for clarity and technical details.</p>
